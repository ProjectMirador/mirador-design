# Mirador 3 Style Guide

This [Mirador 3 style guide](https://projectmirador.github.io/mirador-design/) is intended to document styles and processes related to the design and development of Mirador 3.

This style guide is currently just a prototype. It's intended for determining the potential value of a style guide for Mirador 3 design and development and how such a style guide might be structured. It's based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and was selected based on the ease of updating (most pages can be written in Markdown) and deploying.

Nothing in this style guide is ready for actual use.

# Credits

This style guide is based on the [Jekyll Style Guide](https://github.com/matthewelsom/jekyll-style-guide) by Matthew Elsom. We've customized the content and styling for the Mirador 3 project purposes, but Matthew's project provides the fundamental code structure, page layouts, etc. If you are interested in forking this project you should probably start with the [Jekyll Style Guide](https://github.com/matthewelsom/jekyll-style-guide) rather than the code in this repository.

Additional ideas (especially color, spacing, and typography variables) were take from [Vue Design System](https://github.com/viljamis/vue-design-system) and [Princeton Library's LUX Design System](https://github.com/pulibrary/lux), an implementation of the Vue Design System.
