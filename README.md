## Mirador 3 mockups
We're creating interactive mockups to explore designs for Mirador 3. These are works-in-progress and do not include all details for all features, but we're happy to hear feedback on them. Submit feedback as [an issue in this repository](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador-design/issues).

## Mirador 3 style guide

We'd like to have a style guide to document styles and processes related to the design and development of Mirador 3. Longer-term, the style guide could be a reference for Mirador 3 plug-in developers.

Here's a first stab at a [Mirador 3 style guide](https://projectmirador.github.io/mirador-design/). This is a prototype intended to help determine the potential value of a style guide and how it might be structured. 

Nothing in this style guide is ready for actual use.
